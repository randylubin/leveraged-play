        <h1>Past Games</h1>
        <p>This page contains a number of games we’ve designed or collaborated on. We also have an overview of <a href="/games/game-types.html">types of games</a> that we design.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Positive AI Economic Futures</h3>
        <p>We designed a 4-hour workshop to explore positive visions for the future in a world transformed by artificial intelligence. This workshop was part of a broader initiative by the World Economic Forum, the Center for Human-compatable Artificial Intelligence, and X-Prize. We led 90 economists, technologists, and sci-fi authors through a series of 5 games that built out different possible futures.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Imagining Health Futures</h3>
        <p>Imagining Health Futures is a foresight game in which
          participants explore the future of health in 2035, from
          adolescent perspectives. Designed in support of UNICEF’s Office of Innovation</p>
        
        <h3 class="section-header">Hindsight 2030</h3>
        <p>A lightweight game for envisioning possible tech trends and societal outcomes across the next decade. Players start with provocative headlines from 2030 and then fill in the blanks for how we get there from today.</p>
        
        <h3 class="section-header">Threatcast 2020</h3>
        <p>A brainstorm game focused on how bad actors might use technology to manipulate the 2020 election. Commissioned by a major tech company and run for internal and external experts. Available to run at future events.</p>
        
        <h3 class="section-header">Machine Learning President</h3>
        <p>An event-based Presidential election simulation game that is played with ~50 people. We designed it to explore issues around the intersection of technology, politics, and money. The game has received significant <a href="https://gizmodo.com/machine-learning-president-designers-have-no-idea-how-t-1827120746">attention</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/25/18010142/machine-learning-president-2020-election-larp">praise</a>.</p>
        
         <h3 class="section-header">Walking the Future</h3>
        <p>This game was designed for and run at Refactor Camp 2019, as a way to explore the future of the urban environment. Players spent an hour walking around the neighborhood and answering prompts to envision what the locations will look like ten to twenty years in the future.

        <h3 class="section-header">Climate Change and Land Use</h3>
        <p>Leveraged Play partnered with CollabForge and Monash University’s Sustainable Development Institute to create a game for Climate Week QLD 2019. We designed an experience that kicked off a summit on climate change, land use, and biodiversity that involved senior scientists, business leaders, and government officials who were gathering for the first time with the goal of developing and prioritizing positive interventions.</p>
          <p>We developed a variety of different games and ultimately remixed them into a workshop in which participants quickly iterated on a series of project proposals. Several of those projects are going forward and will hopefully have significant impacts on the environment.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">HAL of Justice</h3>
        <p>This game takes place in the far future, where AI govern the world. Over the course of an hour, players take turns petitioning the AI overlords to amend policies and the audience votes as the AIs. The tone is fun and lighthearted. We ran it at the end of the Internet Policy WIP Conference at Santa Clara Law School as a way for attendees to unwind and have fun at the end of a long day.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">CIA: Collect It All</h3>
        <p>An adaptation of the CIA’s own card-based training game, originally created to train analysts about intelligence collection techniques. We adapted the game from heavily redacted versions released via a Freedom of Information Act request. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/cia-collect-it-all">Sold over 4,000 copies via Kickstarter</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Working Futures</h3>
        <p>A scenario planning game, involving a custom-made deck of cards to help explore different economic, social, political and technological trends. Run to investgate how the future of work might play out and to inspire a volume of sci-fi stories that further explore these scenarios. The <a href="https://workingfutur.es/">game and anthology</a> yeilded great results.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">You Make The Call</h3>
        <p>A game designed for and used at multiple conferences, asking the audience to roleplay as the Trust and Safety team at a large internet social media website. Players must make hard choices about how to deal with a wide variety of controversial content. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIXGkoKfOS0">Video of the game at COMO</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Playing With Disruption</h3>
        <p>A team based game run at a the Disruptive Strategy Summit to push large incumbent organizations to think through disruptive innovations that might completely change their industry.</p>
