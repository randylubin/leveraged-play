        <h1>Past Games</h1>
        <p>This page contains a number of games we’ve designed or collaborated on. We also have an overview of <a href="/games/game-types.html">types of games</a> that we design.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Machine Learning President</h3>
        <p>An event-based Presidential election simulation game that is played with ~50 people. We designed it to explore issues around the intersection of technology, politics, and money. The game has received significant <a href="https://gizmodo.com/machine-learning-president-designers-have-no-idea-how-t-1827120746">attention</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/25/18010142/machine-learning-president-2020-election-larp">praise</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">HAL of Justice</h3>
        <p>This game takes place in the far future, where AI govern the world. Over the course of an hour, players take turns petitioning the AI overlords to amend policies and the audience votes as the AIs. The tone is fun and lighthearted. We ran it at the end of the Internet Policy WIP Conference at Santa Clara Law School as a way for attendees to unwind and have fun at the end of a long day.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">CIA: Collect It All</h3>
        <p>An adaptation of the CIA’s own card-based training game, originally created to train analysts about intelligence collection techniques. We adapted the game from heavily redacted versions released via a Freedom of Information Act request. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/cia-collect-it-all">Sold over 4,000 copies via Kickstarter</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Working Futures</h3>
        <p>A scenario planning game, involving a custom-made deck of cards to help explore different economic, social, political and technological trends. Run to investgate how the future of work might play out. The <a href="https://workingfutur.es/">game</a> yeilded great results.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">You Make The Call</h3>
        <p>A game designed for and used at multiple conferences, asking the audience to roleplay as the Trust and Safety team at a large internet social media website. Players must make hard choices about how to deal with a wide variety of controversial content. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIXGkoKfOS0">Video of the game at COMO</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Playing With Disruption</h3>
        <p>A team based game run at a the Disruptive Strategy Summit to push large incumbent organizations to think through disruptive innovations that might completely change their industry.</p>
