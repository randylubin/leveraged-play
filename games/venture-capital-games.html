        <h1>Games for Venture Capital</h1>

        <p>Leveraged Play designs in-person games that explore the future and explain the present. Our games can help Venture Capital firms accomplish a variety of goals including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Exploring new investment theses</li>
          <li>Communicating theses to LPs and explaining emerging ecosystems</li>
          <li>Strengthening founders' skills</li>
          <li>Building connections among portfolio companies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Founders face an endless sequence of difficult decisions and dilemmas; games can help these founders prepare for the future and also build trust and rapport between the founders, investors, and advisors.</p>

        <p>The pace of innovation is accelerating and exploration games can help partners develop new theses around emerging technologies, regulations, and social trends. Additional games can explain these new theses to LPs and other audiences – games are an excellent method for explaining complex systems.</p>
