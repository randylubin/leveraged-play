## Game Overview

Trust & Safety: Armed Conflict is a browser and mobile game that puts the player in charge of managing the crisis and conflict team at a large social network. Players have to make a series of tough decisions about policies and moderation dilemmas during an international armed conflict. They'll need to balance key metrics tied to local impact, their team's capacity, and public perception, as they navigate a fraught crisis.

### Goal

Our goal was to help players understand that trust and safety work is fundamentally different during an armed conflict situation. The audience was specifically tech workers, government policymakers, and journalists who might have a simplified understanding of the space or of armed conflict dynamics, to help them have more nuanced conversations and make better decisions.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has run the game at multiple conferences and will incorporate it into workshops run with major technology companies.
