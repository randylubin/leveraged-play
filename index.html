        <h2>Why Games</h2>
      </div>
      <p> Through play, participants are free to explore new ideas and novel perspectives. Games are great at modeling complex systems and allow players to build intuitions for real world dynamics. By taking on the roles of key organizations and stakeholders, players can understand their incentives and empathise with their situations.</p>

      <p>Explanation games help participants engage with complex topics through play. By taking on specific roles, players gain intuition of a system’s dynamics and empathy for its key actors. The types of exercises can range from large simulations to focused decision making. These games could be tailored for participants such as conference attendees, new hires, the press, and regulators.</p>
